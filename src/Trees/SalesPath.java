/**
 * The car manufacturer Honda holds their distribution system in the form of a tree
 * (not necessarily binary). The root is the company itself, and every node in the tree
 * represents a car distributor that receives cars from the parent node and ships them
 * to its children nodes. The leaf nodes are car dealerships that sell cars direct to consumers.
 * In addition, every node holds an integer that is the cost of shipping a car to it.
 *
 * A path from Hondaâ€™s factory to a car dealership, which is a path from the root to a leaf
 * in the tree, is called a Sales Path.
 * The cost of a Sales Path is the sum of the costs for every node in the path.
 *
 * Honda wishes to find the minimal Sales Path cost in its distribution tree.
 * Given a node rootNode, write a function getCheapestCost that calculates the minimal
 * Sales Path cost in the tree.
 *
 * Implement your function in the most efficient manner and analyze its time and space complexities.
