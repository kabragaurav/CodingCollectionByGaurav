/**
 * A car factory has two assembly lines, each with n stations. A station
 * is denoted by Si,j where i is either 1 or 2 and indicates the assembly line
 * the station is on, and j indicates the number of the station. The time taken
 * per station is denoted by ai,j. Each station is dedicated to some sort of work
 * like engine fitting, body fitting, painting, and so on. So, a car chassis must
 * pass through each of the n stations in order before exiting the factory. The
 * parallel stations of the two assembly lines perform the same task. After it
 * passes through station Si,j, it will continue to station Si,j+1 unless it decides
 * to transfer to the other line. Continuing on the same line incurs no extra cost,
 * but transferring from line i at station j – 1 to station j on the other line takes
 * time ti,j. Each assembly line takes an entry time ei and exit time xi which may be
 * different for the two lines.
 * Give an algorithm for computing the minimum time it will take to build a car chassis.
