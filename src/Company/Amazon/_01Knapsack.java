/**
 * You are given weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W
 * to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. Note that we have only one quantity of
 * each item.
 * In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..N-1] and wt[0..N-1] which represent values
 * and weights associated with N items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents
 * knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights
 * of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
